# route_map

This was a group project to be implemented in JavaScript, with a team of 4.  This repo is a copy of the team repo, and part of 
the exercise was learning to use git/github in a team collaboration, where previous work had all been solo.  This involved 
the first proper exposure to collaborative merges and the use of feature branches when using git/github.

Use of external APIs was an integral part of the project, and in the event multiple external APIs were integrated into the single page
application.  A back-end server using a no-SQL database (MongoDB) provided data persistence.

The project brief:

You could use GoogleMaps Directions API:
